# pop-POP
Chrome extension that adds effects on screen when you do various mouse events to make it more clear what's happening in screen recordings.

Initially created as a way to mess with mo.js but then realized it has some use. 

## To dos: 
- [ ] add popup.html
- [ ] add handlers for non-mouse events (keypress?)
